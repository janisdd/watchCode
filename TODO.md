# TODO


- real outputs (& with colors) not only log...

- print help

- statistics flag

- log level

- dump log

- check if every config option is accessible via cmd arg & also applied!


- reduce expressions if y includes x and x changed --> y changed! but if x does not change we don't know for y

- maybe: allow [int]- interval --> until file end
- maybe: somehow handle (automatically) if end of interval is bigger than total lines in file (now: output warning, ignore)
  - would involve updating doc files... which is critical

- make readme
- check different encodings... of src file

### if you are creazy

- somehow continue the bottom to top offset idea and maybe include git diff to find the lines??
